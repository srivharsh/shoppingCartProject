# shoppingCartProject

This is a demo project for a shopping cart appplication. We can download the **zip file** from the main branch and see the completed pushed code from **branch1**.
* For creating this application I've used the below technology stack
        1. Java 8
        2. Spring Boot
        3. Hibernate and JPA
        4. Postgres
        5. Maven
        6. Swagger for documentation

* Using this application we can create a shopping cart, retrieve the shopping cart, add products in the shopping cart, update products in the shopping cart, delete product in the shopping cart. 

The project consists of a directory structure comprising of six different packages to split the logic into into multiple Java classes. The packages are:
1) Controller
2) Repository
3) Service
4) Validator
5) Model 
* We've two entities in here with One-to-Many relationship between them:
        1. ShoppingCart
        2. Products
7) Exception

**Approach**: We're exposing RESTful APIs which will help the user to create a shopping cart, retrieve the shopping cart, retrieve a unique cart, get all the products from a cart, get a unique products from a cart, add products in the cart, update a product in the shopping cart, delete product in the shopping cart. Let's see them one by one.

1) createShoppingCart **POST("/api/carts")** : Create a shooping cart by passing the ShoppingCart Object.
2) getShoppingCart **GET("/api/carts")** : Get all the details of the shopping cart.
3) getShoppingCartByCartId **GET("/api/carts/{cartId}")** : Get the shooping cart by passing the ShoppingCart ID.
4) getAllProducts **GET("/api/carts/{cartId}/products")** : Get all the products by passing the ShoppingCart ID.
5) getProductFromShoppingCart **GET("/api/carts/{cartId}/products/productId")** : Get a uinque product from the shoppingCart by passing the ShoppingCart ID and product ID.
6) addProduct **POST("/api/carts/{cartId}/products")** : Add a product in a shopping cart by passing the cart id and the Product Object
7) updateProduct **PUT("/api/carts/{cartId}/products/{productId}"** : Update a particular product in a shopping cart by passing the cart id and the product ID.
8) deleteCart **DELETE("/api/carts/{cartId}/products/{productId}"** : Delete a particular product in a shopping cart by passing the cart id and the product ID.

**Running the application:** To run the application, simply follow the below steps:
1) Download the shoppingCartProject.zip file and unzip it.
2) Import the unzipped file in any of the IDE (Eclipse/STS) by right click > import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Next > Browse for the unzipped file location > Finish.
3) Once the import is done do a Maven Update. Right Click > Maven > Update Project > Select the Project > Click on OK. The project will start updating the maven project.
4) Once the update is done, right click on project > Run As > Spring Boot App. The application will start.
5) Wait until you see :

Your application is **up** now!

You can use **postman** to test the RESTAPIs.
1) www.localhost:9090/api/carts **GET**
2) www.localhost:9090/api/carts **POST**
3) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/{cartId} **GET**
4) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/products **GET**
5) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/{cartId}/products/productId **GET**
6) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/{cartId}/products **POST**
7) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/{cartId}/products/{productId **PUT**
8) www.localhost:9090/api/carts/{cartId}/products/{productId} **DELETE**

You can also use the below URLs for **Swagger** **Document** Implementation.
1) **Docs**: http://localhost:9090/v2/api-docs/
2) **UI**:   http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui.html#/

To configure **Postgre**:

We'll use - > psql â€“ a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL database server.
1) Download postgres, open up a cmd terminal and navigate to the bin folder.
2) Use "psql --username="postgres" -W" and it will prompt for password.
3) Enter "admin" as the deault password.
4) You're now connected. Use "\l" to list all the available databases.
5) Connect to testdb using "\c testdb" and again you'll be prompted for password. Enter "admin" as the password.
6) You will now be connected to database "testdb" as user "postgres".
7) You can use "\d" to list down all the tables.

I've used docker to create a docker image and have pushed this image to dockerhub. Then I've configured a EC2 instance to run this docker image using AWS ECS. I've written a blog about it at medium:
